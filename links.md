- [Configuring standard policies for all repositories in Azure Repos](https://jessehouwing.net/azure-repos-git-configuring-standard-policies-on-repositories/)
  - By default you can only configure policies on specific branches in Azure Repos. If you're using a strict naming pattern for your branches (Release Flow or GitHub Flow), you may want to set a policy for all future Release Branches, or all Feature branches.
