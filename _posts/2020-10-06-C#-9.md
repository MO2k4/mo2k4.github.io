## Top-Level-Statements

It is now possible to get a quickstart way into C#. A standard "Hello World" app would now look like this:

```csharp
using System;

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
```

Can you spot the difference? Right there is no boilerplate for namespace, classes, static main etc.

There can be only one file with top level statements and they need to be written first, before types and namespaces.

```csharp
using System;

var person = new Person();

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

## Init-Only Properties

There is a new way to initialize a class. The next example shows the previous way for declaring an immutable object.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public Person(string firstname, string lastname)
    {
        FirstName = firstname;
        LastName = lastname;
    }

    public string FirstName { get; }
    public string LastName { get; }
}

var person = new Person("John", "Doe");
```

This can now be rewritten as following.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
}

var person = new Person
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};
```

Notice that we are missing the boilerplate code for the constructor. We are now able to use the object initialization and is also possible to use the init accessor with a readonly field with additional checks.

```csharp
public class Person
{
    private readonly string _lastname;

    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName
    {
        get => _lastname;
        init => _lastname =
                    value ??
                    throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(LastName), "Lastname shouldn't be null");
    }
}
```

## Target-typed new expressions

Previously you would write something like this:

```csharp
Person person1 = new Person();
// or
var person2 = new Person();
```

And with C# 9 you could write this like this:

```csharp
Person person = new();
```

But whats the benefit in using this feature? This will be clearer after seeing this example:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    protected readonly Dictionary<string, List<string>> _dictionary = new();
}
```

Isn't this beautiful? How clear it is and now we have less duplication of code. We can use this new() syntax whenever it is clear from the left side which type should be used.

## Immutable data classes

Imagine you work with immutable data like this:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
}
```

If you would now like to change the lastname after marriage you would need to create a new object, copy every field and change the lastname.

```csharp
public record Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
}

var person = new Person
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};

var personAfterMarriage = person with { LastName = "Meier" };
```

This new with syntax works only with records and not with classes!

Record types are reference types and the Equals method is implemented for you. The compiler will generate the Equals method and also the operator overloads for == and !=.

```csharp
var person = new Person
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};

var newPerson = person with { FirstName = "Jane" };

Console.WriteLine(person == newPerson ? "Equal" : "Not Equal"); // "Not Equal"

var anotherPerson = newPerson with { FirstName = "John"};

Console.WriteLine(person == anotherPerson ? "Equal" : "Not Equal"); // "Equal"
```

The record type can also be used the a constructor or a deconstruct method.

```csharp
public record Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }

    public Person(string firstname, string lastname)
    {
        FirstName = firstname;
        LastName = lastname;
    }

    public void Deconstruct(out string firstname, out string lastname)
    {
        firstname = FirstName;
        lastname = LastName;
    }
}

var person = new Person("John", "Doe");

var (firstname, lastname) = person;
Console.WriteLine(firstname); // "John"
Console.WriteLine(lastname); // "Doe"
```

There is also the possibility to write a **Positional Record**

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
```

This creates a record type with the public init-only properties, a public constructor and a deconstruct method!

And you can also use inheritance!

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age);

public record Employee(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age, string Position) : Person(FirstName, LastName, Age);
```

## Improved pattern matching

```csharp
public static decimal CalculateToll(object vehicle) =>
    vehicle switch
    {
        DeliveryTruck t when t.GrossWeightClass > 5000 => 10.00m + 5.00m,
        DeliveryTruck t when t.GrossWeightClass < 3000 => 10.00m - 2.00m,
        DeliveryTruck _ => 10.00m,

        _ => throw new ArgumentException("Not a known vehicle type", nameof(vehicle))
    };
```

Now it is possible to get a simple type pattern without declaring a identifier.

```csharp
DeliveryTruck => 10.0m,
```

Or you could use some relational pattern?

```csharp
DeliveryTruck t when t.GrossWeightClass switch
{
    > 5000 => 10m + 5m,
    < 3000 => 10m - 2m,
    _ => 10m
}
```

Or some logical pattern?

```csharp
DeliveryTruck t when t.GrossWeightClass switch
{
    >= 3000 and <= 5000 => 10m,
}
```

## Target type **??** and **?**

C# 9.0 will recognize a type if there is a shared type

```csharp
Person person = student ?? customer;
int? result = b ? 0 : null;
```
