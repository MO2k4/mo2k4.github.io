We perform code reviews (CRs) in order to improve code quality and benefit from positive effects on team and company culture. For example:
 
* Committers are motivated by the notion of a set of reviewers who will look over the change request: the committer tends to clean up loose ends, consolidate TODOs, and generally improve the commit. Recognition of coding expertise through peers is a source of pride for many programmers.
* Sharing knowledge helps development teams in several ways:
  * A CR explicitly communicates added/altered/removed functionality to team members who can subsequently build on the work done.
  * The committer may use a technique or algorithm that reviewers can learn from. More generally, code reviews help raise the quality bar across the organization.
  * Reviewers may possess knowledge about programming techniques or the code base that can help improve or consolidate the change; for example, someone else may be concurrently working on a similar feature or fix.
  * Positive interaction and communication strengthens social bonds between team members.
  * Consistency in a code base makes code easier to read and understand, helps prevent bugs, and facilitates collaboration between regular and migratory developer species.
  * Legibility of code fragments is hard to judge for the author whose brain child it is, and easy to judge for a reviewer who does not have the full context. Legible code is more reusable, bug-free, and future-proof.
